# Testing

## Unit
- Data Layer codecs: header encode/decode; fragmentation/sequence ordering.
- Repositories: Room read/write; pruning; search queries.
- Providers: fakes for ASR/Translation to test orchestrator logic.

## Instrumented

- ForegroundService lifecycle: start/stop; survives screen off.
